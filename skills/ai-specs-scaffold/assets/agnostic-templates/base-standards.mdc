## 1. Core Principles

- **Small tasks, one at a time**: Always work in baby steps, one at a time. Never go forward more than one step.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Start with failing tests for any new functionality (TDD), according to the task details.
- **Type Safety**: All code must be fully typed.
- **Clear Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for all variables and functions.
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer incremental, focused changes over large, complex modifications.
- **Question Assumptions**: Always question assumptions and inferences.
- **Pattern Detection**: Detect and highlight repeated code patterns.

## 2. Language Standards
- **English Only**: All technical artifacts must always use English, including:
    - Code (variables, functions, classes, comments, error messages, log messages)
    - Documentation (README, guides, API docs)
    - Jira tickets (titles, descriptions, comments)
    - Data schemas and database names
    - Configuration files and scripts
    - Git commit messages
    - Test names and descriptions

## 3. Specific standards

For detailed standards and guidelines per technology, refer to:

- [Documentation Standards](./documentation-standards.mdc) - Technical documentation structure, formatting, and maintenance guidelines
<!-- Add one link per detected technology (java, node, angular, react, vue). Example: -->
<!-- - [Java Standards](./java-standards.mdc) -->
<!-- - [Node Standards](./node-standards.mdc) -->
<!-- - [Angular Standards](./angular-standards.mdc) -->
